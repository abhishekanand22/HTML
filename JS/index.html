    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>

    <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero 
        idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a 
        character with whom teens could identify.[15]:1 As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of 
        his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.[16] In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime 
        fighter the Spider as a great influence,[14]:130 [17] and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated 
        he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wallâ€”adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has 
        become unsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1] Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the 
        criminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years) and had through years of ceaseless struggle developed
         a "sixth sense", which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's "spider-sense".
